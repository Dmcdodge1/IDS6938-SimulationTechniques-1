# Part 1: Empirical Tests of Randomness (20 pts)

* **(a) - 3pts: Output the results of five different random number engines, using a uniform distribution for values between [0-100]. Generate useful charts and statistics from the output to analyze how uniform these values truly are. You are expected to look at some advanced statistics and test, for example: tests like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Chi-square test, Autocorrelation test, and Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient are a few examples of ones your could use.)

* **(b) - 2pts:**  Vary *N* (amount of samples). How do things change.

When changing the N to a much higher number, patterns were substantially clearer compared to the lower Ns. Because this is "random" I ran this experiment a few times and obtained fluctuating results. Means, ranges, variances, Chi scores, Standard deviations, etc. all fluctuated lower and higher than the very large data set of 100,000. For the most part though, the variances of the smaller data sets were larger as well as the standard deviations, but once again this is "random," so it can be flipped around if I were to run it again.

# Assignment
## Part 0 - Getting Started
Read the assignment. Sync your fork with the [main IDS6938 repository](https://github.com/hepcatjk/IDS6938-SimulationTechniques). Use CMake to create project files for the Homework 2 assignment (*Hint: and Discrete Lecture folders*). Set your *startup project* to the correct project. Test building and executing the homework 2 project. Look over and understand the framework and find the functions you need to edit for the assignment.
>>>>>>> upstream/master

* **(c)- 3pts:** Fix a random engine of your choice from part (a), and now vary five different [distributions](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/) for just the psedo-random numbers. Again, analyze your results with graphs and statistics of choice.

I chose the minstd_rand engine.

## Part 1: Empirical Tests of Randomness (20 pts).
We looked at different ways to generate [pseudo-random numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator) and [quasi random numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-discrepancy_sequence). Generating random numbers are crucial to Discrete-Event simulations which rely on random variables and stochastic processes. This problem explores different random number generators, distributions, and statistics. Different [C++ pseudo-random numbers engines are instantiated](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/) already for you. Also a a wide variety of standard distributions are implemented. Two quasi random number generators are also provided. - One must be the Sobel - quasi random number generator.
* **(a) - 3pts:** Output the results of five different random number engines, using a uniform distribution for values between [0-100]. Generate useful charts and statistics from the output to analyze how uniform these values truly are. You are expected to look at some advanced statistics and test, for example: tests like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Chi-square test, Autocorrelation test, and Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient are a few examples of ones your could use.)
* **(b) - 2pts:**  Vary *N* (amount of samples). How do things change.
* **(c) - 3pts:** Fix a random engine of your choice from part (a), and now vary five different [distributions](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/) for just the psedo-random numbers. Again, analyze your results with graphs and statistics of choice.
>>>>>>> upstream/master
* **(d)- 4pts:** Generate random numbers in two-dimensions for a unit square. Plot the results for the different random number engines. The vertical axis should vary N in increasing order. The horizontal axis should show of the random number engines.
* **(e)- 4pts:** Generate random numbers in two-dimensions for a unit square. Plot the results for the different distributions. The vertical axis should vary N in increasing order. The horizontal axis should show of the random number engines. (See [Random Numbers Webcourse page](https://webcourses.ucf.edu/courses/1246518/pages/random-numbers?module_item_id=10541423) for a rough idea what you should produce.)

# Part 2 - Snakes and Ladders (Discrete Event Markov Chains and Monte Carlo Simulations) (30 pts)

* **(a) Null State Game transition matrix - 10pts:** The *null state game* is defined by a game with no snakes and no ladders. This simplifies the game to just the moves of the two dice rolls. Create the transition matrix for the null state game. The Transition Matrix would be decided by the roll of a fair, six-sided die, so it would start to look like:
<BR>![](images/null.png?raw=true)<BR>
From state 0 it is equally probable of landing on squares 1-6. From state 1 t is equally probable of landing on squares 2-7, and so on. Create this transition matrix. The end is trickier, we will consider any roll past 100 a win case. (Opposed to rolling exactly onto square 100.) Confirm you have a well formed stochastic matrix (Write checks for confirming each row of T sums to one and all elements are non-negative). The Transition Matrix methods can be found in the TransitionMatrix.h file.

The Matrix is in the TransitionMatrix.h file.

* **(b) Simulate and analyze the results of Null State Game - 10pts:** What is the modal number of moves required by a single player to finish the game? We will be simulating the game two different ways. **(1) Markov Chain**: The game can be analyzed with a row vector, *v* with 101 components, representing the probabilities that the player is on each of the positions. V(0) is (1,0,0,...,0) since we know we start at square 0. v evolves by: <BR>![](images/prob.png?raw=true)<BR>
For this part (1) use the *Markov project* in the Snake and Ladders starter code.<BR>
**(2) Monte Carlo**: he will will use a monte carlo process to solve our Discrete Time Markov Chains. Here (2) use the DTMC project, and utilize the DTMC method similar to what we did in class. <BR><BR>Produce graphs to analyze the results and show how the game evolves over time for both methods. Plot useful statistics of the results such as percentage chance of finishing the game in n-moves, cumulative probability of finishing the game in n-moves, and other ways to convey useful information of the results.

You can beat the game in just seven roles. The Modal number of rolls required to complete a game is 20. That's a pretty quick game. The average number of die rolls per game is approx 36.2.

* **(c) Simulate and analyze the results of Snakes and Ladders -10pts:**  Construct a new transition matrix based on the table:


Ladders From  | Ladders To | |  Snakes From  | Snakes To 
-------- | -------- | ------------- | -------- | -------- 
3|19| |11|7
15|37| |18|13
22|42| |28|12
25|64| |36|34
41|73| |77|16
53|74| |47|26
63|86| |83|39
76|91| |92|75
84|98| |99|70

********In the code*****************

Run the same simulation and analyze your results similar to part (b) for the proper game of *Snakes and Ladders* for both methods. How often are the snakes and ladders used, how do the probability of finishing change, etc? What is the maximum and expected amount of moves for the game? Use charts and graphs to illustrate these points.
* **(d) Think - 0pts:** If these games are built entirely on chance, do they require any strategy? Is it really a *game*, would you rather play games of chance or games of strategy?

# Part 4 - Implementing Extra Features (10 pts)

<<<<<<< HEAD
Implementing 2 features on the extra features list. Pick any feature on the "*extra features*" list below to customize your assignment to fit your interests. Please document this in your writeup. (*Note: These should total 10pts. You could successfully implement a feature worth 10pts or greater. This also fulfills this requirement. The features are assigned points based on difficulty. The 5pt features are more straightforward.*)

For another class I am doing research on how different assembly lines alter total output and I thought this would be a great addition. I can improve upon this and even create different layouts!
* **(10 Points)** - Setup another resource allocation / queueing problem related to your research in Anylogic with a basic visualization

Anylogic folder also uploaded.
